_Note:_ I feel that I have made this too ambitious, so I archived this project in January 2024. You are welcome to use this code elsewhere or to continue development.

# Welcome to the FreeCardAndBoard project!
This is planned to be a free and open source cross-platform Java card and board game compendium program. I am still working on the basic structure, but the following games are planned for its initial release:
1. Backgammon
2. Bridge
3. Canasta
4. Checkers
5. Chess
6. Chinese Checkers/Halma
7. Crazy Eights
8. Cribbage
9. Dominoes (block and draw games, all spinner rules)
10. Go
11. Hearts
12. Janggi
13. Mancala
14. Ninety-nine ([the trick-taking game](http://www.parlettgames.uk/oricards/ninety9.html))
15. Old Maid
16. Reversi
17. Rummy
18. Shōgi
19. Spades
20. Whist
21. Xiàngqí

I am open to adding more games over time (ludo, tarot/tarock, etc.) but I think this is a good set of games to start with.

Feel free to chip in if you'd like to help! Please read the [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you begin. I also have two similar projects for different categories of games, [FreeCasino](https://github.com/StrangerCoug/FreeCasino) and [FreeSolitaire](https://github.com/StrangerCoug/FreeSolitaire); this project often shares code with the other two.

This is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project; therefore, you will need Maven to build the program.
